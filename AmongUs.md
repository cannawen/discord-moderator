- No one is allowed to send game-related private messages to the members on the opposite team
- Each team will have an imposter who wins if the other team wins
- Each team will know who the other team's imposter is, but they will not know who the imposter is on their own team
- The imposter may try to grief their team to make them lose
- When the game ends, the losing team will have a chance to vote on who their team's imposter is
- If 3 or more people correctly identify the imposter, the losing team wins

## Setup

- Participants must be split into `Radiant` or `Dire` voice channels before the game starts
- The game begins on trigger phrase `There is an imposter among us` or slash command `/amongus`
- One imposter will be randomly selected from each team, and receive a private discord message informing them that they work for the other team
- Every participant will receive a message stating who the imposter is on the other team

## Feedback
